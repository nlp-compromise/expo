module.exports = `Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down.
and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.

In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days.
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school.
When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood,
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air".

I whistled for a cab and when it came near. The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.
If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it" â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air"!

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later".
I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.
