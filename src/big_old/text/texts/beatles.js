module.exports = `When I call you up your line's engaged.
I have had enough, so act your age,
We have lost the time that was so hard to find,
And I will lose my mind,
If you won't see me, you won't see me.

I don't know why you should want to hide,
But I can't get through my hands are tied,
I won't want to stay I don't have much to say,
But I get turned away.
And you won't see me, you won't see me.

Time after time you refuse to even listen,
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.
Though the days are few they're filled with tears,
And since I lost you it feels like years,
Yes it seems so long girl since you've been gone,
I just can't go on,
If you won't see me, you won't see me.
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
