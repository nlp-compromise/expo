module.exports = `My girl's got a big mouth with which she blabbers a lot.
She laughs at most everything, whether it's funny or not.
And if you see her tell her it's over now.

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else.
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf.
When I'm away she never leaves the house.
I want a girl who laughs for no one else .

My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head.
She looks around and around. You know it makes me sad to see her like that.
Please don't believe her - she says that for anyone.
And if you see her tell her it's over.

Let's go away for a while, you and I, to a strange and distant land, where they speak no word of truth, but we don't understand anyway.

A holiday far away to stay.
Far away, let's go today.
In a heartbeat!

Don't bother to pack your bags or your map, we won't need them where we're going.
We're going where the wind is blowing not knowing where we're gonna stay.

We will write a postcard to our friends and family in free verse.
On the road with Kerouac, sheltered in his Bivouac, on this road we'll never die...

My girl's a liar, but I'll stand beside her.
She's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.

My girl don't see me when she's with my friends.
She's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.

No, there is no other one.
I can't have any other one.
Though I would, now I never could with one.

All of the drugs she does scare me real good.
She's got a tattoo and two pet snakes.
Nobody knows me like her.
Nobody knows her like me.
We're all we've got and we don't want to be alone.

What's with these homies, dissing my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?
Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care bout that

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian
Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time.

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care bout that.

Bang, bang a knock on the door
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter babe are you feeling sick?
what's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter babe, are you feeling blue? oh-oh!
And that's for all time.

Oo-ee-oo I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care bout that.

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

I just made love with your sweet memory
One thousand times in my head
You said you loved it more than ever
You said

You remain turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

I talked for hours to your wallet photograph
And you just listened
You laughed enchanted by my intellect
Or maybe you didn't

You remain turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

Do you believe what I sing now?
`
