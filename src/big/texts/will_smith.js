module.exports = `Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down.
and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air.

In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where I spent most of my days.
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school.
When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood,
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air".

I whistled for a cab and when it came near. The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror.
If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it" â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air"!

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later".
I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.

Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green v
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight

I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down (boom)
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit

It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representing like it's ladies night
Coming right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink
Rocks in the link, In the drop with a mink
Like my shit don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam
Blowing up spots then running off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passing
Breaking you down like fractions
While we be rapping about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it platinum
With Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace
With a sweet smell
This female leading the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real?
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal

Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it

On your mark ready set let's go, dance floor pro
I know you know I go psycho
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Got to get jiggy with it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid, wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it, getting jiggy with it

What you want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)
I makes it hot, getting jiggy with 'em

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly, getting jiggy with it

Excuse me Miss, can we chat for a second
I'd ask how you doin', but you fine I reckon
Wait, do you have a man, cause I ain't' into homewrecking
No? ...Aight cool just checking
Look, from a hundred yards you caught my eye
An all my boys said I didn't have the heart to say hi
I'd like to have your number you don't have ta give it now
But if you diss me while they lookin I'm a never live it down
Y'know what I mean, Aww damn, my name's Will
Maxine. Pleasure to meet you, look here's the deal
Can I sit? Thanks, now I don't mean to objectify
But this the metaphore that crossed my mind
You sweet, good enough to eat
Make a brother wanna TLC--Creep
A brother can't sleep
It's like a kid fallin for you
So here's my own private nickname, I'm a call you

Candy (no doubt, do you wanna bounce?)
It's the same feelin I always seem to get around you
Let's get this started now

I ain't gonna lie to you, I remember layin eyes on you
All I thought about was livin life beside you, Boo
All I wanna do is be the perfect guy to you
Tell you the truth, it's like (Candy) cause I'm feelin like its callin me
You're tryin ta hold on, but fallin
Seem quite far ta me
I stay strong but it's hard to be
Cause somethin bringin out the dog in me
(It's like Candy) when I'm keepin my zone
Chat on the phone, I lower my tone
Steady plottin on takin ya home
Gettin all inside of your dome, makin you moan
You shoulda known (It's like Candy)
As I'm seein you here, Mommy I know your peepin my stare
And feelin my glare, brother thinkin bout unrollin the bear
Strokin your hair, (Touchin me where?) Yeah there

I know the deal, I talked to Mary Jane and she said
Your ex-boyfriends Mike and Ike are both Lemonheads
I ain't tryin ta player hate girl I know
That you go with Bazooka Joe
Now you know he don't love you like that
He tryin ta get a Reeses piece of the Kit-Kat
Really hon, what he need is a jawbreaker
Cause I'm the one that'll love you baby Now and Later
Be my Peppermint Paddy with a Hundred wishes
An I'll be your Hershey daddy with a hundred kisses
Get the Twins M&M's, they booked all outta flights today
Me an you can Starburst to the Milky Way
I don't care what it cost, girl a Hundred Grand
We could snicker all night at my Jolly Ranch
Just me and you, I'll call your friends up too
Cause I could get my friends Babe Ruth and Charleston Chew
