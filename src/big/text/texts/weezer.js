module.exports = `My girl's got a big mouth with which she blabbers a lot.
She laughs at most everything, whether it's funny or not.
And if you see her tell her it's over now.

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else.
When I'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf.
When I'm away she never leaves the house.
I want a girl who laughs for no one else .

My girl's got eyeballs in the back of her head.
She looks around and around. You know it makes me sad to see her like that.
Please don't believe her - she says that for anyone.
And if you see her tell her it's over.

Let's go away for a while, you and I, to a strange and distant land, where they speak no word of truth, but we don't understand anyway.

A holiday far away to stay.
Far away, let's go today.
In a heartbeat!

Don't bother to pack your bags or your map, we won't need them where we're going.
We're going where the wind is blowing not knowing where we're gonna stay.

We will write a postcard to our friends and family in free verse.
On the road with Kerouac, sheltered in his Bivouac, on this road we'll never die...

My girl's a liar, but I'll stand beside her.
She's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.

My girl don't see me when she's with my friends.
She's all I've got and I don't want to be alone.

No, there is no other one.
I can't have any other one.
Though I would, now I never could with one.

All of the drugs she does scare me real good.
She's got a tattoo and two pet snakes.
Nobody knows me like her.
Nobody knows her like me.
We're all we've got and we don't want to be alone.
